Jo√£o Paulo was born in Portugal in 1986. Currently, he is an Invited Auxiliar Professor at University of Minho and an Assistant Researcher at HASLab, one of the research units of INESC TEC and University of Minho. He obtained a Computer Engineering degree from the University of Minho in 2007 and a MSc degree from the same university in 2009. He obtained his PhD degree, in the context of the MAP-i Doctoral Programme, from the universities of Minho, Aveiro and Porto in 2015.

His research is focused on large scale distributed systems with an emphasis on storage and database systems' scalability, performance, security and dependability. Namely, he is interested on the applicability of such research for solving complex data management challenges for Cloud Computing and HPC centers. 

He has several publications on top journals and international conferences (ACM Computing Surveys, ACM Transactions on Storage, IEEE Transactions on Computers, Eurosys, SRDS), and has participated in the research and development of EU and national projects. Namely, he is the coordinator of the "Efficient and Secure Data Management for HPC and Cloud Computing" CENTRA project and the PAStor PT-UTAustin Exploratory project, while coordinating INESC TEC's activities on the Compete2020 BigHPC project and ACTPM PT-UTAustin Exploratory project. Also, he has been involved in the PASTRAMY and RED national projects, and in the FP7 CoherentPaaS and H2020 SafeCloud European projects. In the latter, he was actively involved in both technical and coordination tasks. 

He has served the committee of distinct conferences on storage and distributed systems, such as SRDS, SYSTOR, DAIS, Usenix HotStorage and WVT.
