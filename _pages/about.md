I am currently an invited assistant professor at University of Minho and a senior researcher at [HASLab](https://www.inesctec.pt/en/centres/haslab), one of the research units of INESC TEC and University of Minho.

My current research topics include:

**Reliable Distributed Storage Systems**: My current research work focuses on software-defined storage architectures and very-large scale storage systems. As some examples, I am interested in storage deduplication, stackable filesystems, and storage security. I am also interested in improving the performance of current storage solutions for HPC and AI workloads.

**Benchmarking and Monitoring Storage Systems**: Another research interest is on building proper benchmarking tools for monitoring and evaluating storage systems accurately.

**Databases**: Also, previous and current research work is focused on SQL and NoSQL databases and privacy/security.
