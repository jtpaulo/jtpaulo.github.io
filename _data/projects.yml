  dates: 2018-Current
  description: "The 'Efficient and Secure Data Management for HPC and Cloud Computing' project aims at researching novel data management solutions for Cloud and HPC distributed environments. These solutions must be efficient, secure, and practical by: 1) alleviating any storage or processing performance bottlenecks identified for data-centric applications deployed on HPC and Cloud services; 2) following a privacy-by-design approach when storing and processing sensitive data on third-party infrastructures; and 3) re-using stable and industry-adopted storage systems, databases and analytical platforms. I am currently the coordinator of this project, which is being done in collaboration with the KISTI and AIST research centers (South Korea and Japan). It also includes external collaborations with researchers from TACC and UT Austin."

  dates: 2020-2021
  description: "Persistent Memory (PM) provides a novel point in the traditional memory hierarchy that promises to improve the performance and efficiency of applications. However, to fully exploit these capabilities, novel tools to assess the correctness of these applications under faults are needed. The research conducted in this project, and the resulting tools, will advance the state-of-the-art in the above areas and improve the workflow and efficiency of PM application developers to ultimately leading to safer and more performant applications that fully leverage PM capabilities. I am responsible for INESC TEC's activities and team in the project. The project includes the following partners: INESC ID (coordinator), UTAustin (coordinator), INESC TEC."

  dates: 2015-2018
  description: "Cloud infrastructures, despite all their advantages and importance to the competitiveness of modern economies, raise fundamental questions related to the privacy, integrity, and security of offsite data storage and processing tasks. There are major privacy and security concerns about data located in the cloud, especially when data is physically located, processed, or must transit outside the legal jurisdiction of its rightful owner. These questions are currently not answered satisfactorily by existing technologies. SafeCloud will re-architect cloud infrastructures to ensure secure and private data transmission, storage, and processing. My work on this project led to the conception and development of privacy-preserving databases and filesystems."

  dates: 2015-2016
  description: "CoherentPaaS combines in an integrated platform SQL (OLTP, in-memory analytics, OLAP), NoSQL (key-value, document-oriented and graph databases) and CEP/data streaming. In this platform applications can start global transactions and update any combination of data stores with full transactional semantics. Applications can also make queries across data stores combining the simplicity of SQL with the power of the underlying native query languages. My work involved the conception of a scalable transactional logging mechanism for large-scale distributed databases."

  dates: 2010-2012
  description: "It might look simple at first sight to extend the shared-nothing protocol to cope with shared storage: If all replicas perform exactly the same write operations, database state would be identical and thus could be shared. Unfortunately, internal non-determinism means that different physical images are produced regardless of logical consistency, leading to corruption. Moreover, such simple approach would not preserve the logical independence of replicas and rule out tolerating Byzantine faults. The ReD approach is to combine the replication protocol with a specialized copy-on-write volume management system, that holds transient logically independent partial copies, thus masking internal server non-determinism and isolating multiple logical replicas for resilience. My work was focused on database replication, shared storage cluster and storage virtualization. More specifically, the shared-storage cluster approach using mySQL was ported to a virtualized environment that uses XEN."
