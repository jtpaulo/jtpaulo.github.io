I am currently an assistant professor at University of Minho and a senior researcher at [HASLab](https://www.inesctec.pt/en/centres/haslab), one of the research units of INESC TEC and University of Minho.

My current research topics include:

**Reliable Distributed Storage Systems**: My current research work is focused on software-defined storage architectures and large scale storage systems. As some examples, I am interested in storage deduplication, stackable filesystems, and storage security. I am also interested in improving the performance of current storage solutions for HPC and AI workloads.

**Benchmarking, Monitoring and Debugging Storage Systems**: Another research interest is on building proper tools for monitoring, diagnosing and evaluating storage systems accurately.

**Databases**: Also, previous and current research work is focused on SQL and NoSQL databases and privacy/security.

For more information on these topics you can check the [Distributed Storage](https://dsr-haslab.github.io) research team webpage (which I am coordinating).
